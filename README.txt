SOGO Manila Tourist Map - Full Integration Package
--------------------------------------------------

Files:
- index.html : Main branded mobile web app that loads your Google My Maps KML (public) and shows SOGO branches + attractions.
- logo.png    : SOGO logo used in the header.

Install to GitHub Pages:
1. Go to your repository: https://github.com/domasiannath-24/sogo-manila-map
2. Upload index.html and logo.png to the root of the repository (commit to main branch).
3. In GitHub: Settings -> Pages -> Deploy from a branch -> Branch: main, Folder: / -> Save
4. Wait ~1 minute, then open: https://domasiannath-24.github.io/sogo-manila-map/

Notes:
- The app reads KML from: https://www.google.com/maps/d/kml?mid=11_1oDpmSF82c-pW6lDbyraJnzRqwFZI&forcekml=1
- Ensure your Google My Maps sharing is set to 'Anyone with the link can view'.
- The app is privacy-first: no analytics, no tracking, no login, no install required.
